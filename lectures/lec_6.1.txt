React Routing
react does not provide built in support for routing, we can use routing in react app using react-router-dom

axios - for fetching API

npm install react-router-dom axios

1. BrowserRouter --> which provides pretty urls

/home
2. Routes --> switching between routes/ collection of Route
3. Route --> individual route
