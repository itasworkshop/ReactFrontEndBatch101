Redux --> "state container"

pridictable state for JS apps

state container for JS apps

immutable object which has global state

1) why do we need redux?
class level state are managed --> but global level is managed by redux

2)Redux devtools extension in chrome --> for debugging and dev purpose

contextAPI is suitable for smaller application state management but not suitable for larger application.
